# Atari-2600-Deep-Learning-Agent
This program was created as my final year project for my undergraduate Computer Science degree. It is used for performing deep reinforcement learning
experiments on the Atari 2600. It can launch a range of game environments using AIGym, and then train agents how to play based on a pre-determined
set of hyper parameters. The user can determine several program parameters based on the experiment they wish to carry out.

## Program Requirements
The following software is required:
* Python 3.6 or later (Recommended: Anaconda for easy installation)
* *(Python Package)* Gym
* *(Python Package)* Tensorflow
* Microsoft Build Tools for Visual Studio 2015/2017

## Windows Installation Procedure
To prepare a Windows system to run this program, the following steps should be followed;
With Anaconda installed on the machine, open a CLI and enter the following commands;
`conda install git`
`conda update --all`
`conda clean -a`
`pip install git+https://github.com/Kojoley/atari-py.git`
`pip install gym[atari]`
`pip install --upgrade tensorflow`
